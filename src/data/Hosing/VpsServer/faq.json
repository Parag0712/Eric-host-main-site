            "question": "What is VPS Hosting?",
            "answer": "VPS Hosting is a web hosting solution that utilizes virtualization technology to create isolated server environments within a physical server. It offers users more control, customization, and performance compared to shared hosting as each VPS operates independently with its dedicated resources."

            "question": "How Does VPS Hosting Differ from Shared Hosting?",
            "answer": "VPS Hosting provides dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to each virtual server, whereas Shared Hosting is where multiple websites share resources on a single server. This isolation provides more stability and customization options and ensures that the performance of one website on a VPS does not affect others."

            "question": "Can I Install Custom Software on My VPS?",
            "answer": "Yes, you can install custom software on your VPS. With full root or administrator access, you have the freedom to install and configure any compatible software, applications, or scripts based on your requirements. This is one of the pertinent advantages of VPS Hosting."

        {
            "value": "item-10",
            "question": "Is VPS Hosting Environment-Friendly?",
