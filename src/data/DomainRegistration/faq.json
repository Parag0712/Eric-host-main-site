            "answer": "To register a domain, you need to choose a domain name that reflects your brand or business and check its availability using a domain registrar's website. Once you find an available domain name, you can proceed to register it by providing your contact information and completing the registration process.

The process involves unlocking your domain at your current registrar, obtaining an authorization code (if required), and initiating the transfer with your new registrar. Both registrars must support domain transfers, and there may be fees associated with the transfer process. Additionally, ensure that your domain is eligible for transfer and that you meet any requirements set by the respective registrars."

            "question": "What is WHOIS Privacy Protection?",
            "answer": "WHOIS privacy protection, also known as domain privacy or WHOIS masking, is a service offered by some domain registrars to protect the privacy of domain owners. When you register a domain, your contact information, including name, address, email, and phone number, is typically made publicly available in the WHOIS database. WHOIS privacy protection replaces your personal information with generic contact details provided by the registrar, shielding your identity from spammers, marketers, and other third parties who may misuse your information. It helps reduce unwanted solicitations and spam while maintaining your privacy online."
